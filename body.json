Son scored after an own-goal from Joel Ward had given the away side the lead. Spurs are guaranteed to be top despite what happens for the rest of the weekend as they have a cushion of five points over their rivals.LONDON, ENGLAND - OCTOBER 27: Son Heung-Min of Tottenham Hotspur celebrates with teammates after scoring the team's second goal during the Premier League match between Crystal Palace and Tottenham Hotspur at Selhurst Park on October 27, 2023 in London, EnImage credit: Getty ImagesHeung-Min Son and James Maddison starred as Tottenham moved five points clear at the top of the Premier League with a 2-1 victory that condemned Crystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson to defeat on his 500th match in charge of English clubs in all competitions.  Ange Postecoglou\u2019s table-toppers took their time to hit their stride and it was The Eagles who posed the greater threat on the counter attack with Jordan Ayew and Odsonne Edouard both going close. Spurs had 73% of the possession but struggled to carve out any clear-cut openings as they failed to register a shot on target in the first half for the first time this season. Premier LeagueSilva signs new three-year contract with Fulham24/10/2023 at 16:23Patience was the key and The Lilywhites eventually broke the deadlock in fortuitous fashion when Maddison\u2019s cross-shot was diverted into his own net by Joel Ward on 53 minutes. Palace lacked the cutting edge to make life uncomfortable for the away side and Spurs doubled their advantage past the hour when Son tucked in following lovely build-up from Maddison and substitute Brennan Johnson down the left. Ayew struck a brilliant volley into the far corner deep into stoppage time to give The Eagles brief hope, but it wasn\u2019t enough to deny The Lilywhites the three points. The result means Spurs now have eight wins and 26 points from 10 games played with a five-point cushion over second-placed Manchester City ahead of the rest of the weekend\u2019s action. Palace are 11th on 12 points and have won just once in their last seven matches in all competitions.    Tottenham will aim to maintain their unbeaten start to the league season at home to Chelsea next Monday. Palace visit Burnley next Saturday.  Premier League tablePremier League fixtures / resultsPremier League top scorersTalking Point - Spurs stay patient to maintain best Premier League start to a campaign This was far from Tottenham\u2019s best display of the season, but once again they found a way to secure a win that moves them five points clear in the top-flight for the first time since the 1960-61 campaign, when they went on to win the Double.The feel-good factor under Ange looks like it\u2019s here to stay and there were plenty of positive to take from this victory at Selhurst Park.Son took his tally to eight for the season as he thrives in a centre-forward role while new boys Maddison and Micky van de Ven continue to shine.There was even the good news of a late appearance off the bench from Rodrigo Bentancur, who put the seal on the night with his first outing since returning from a serious, long-term ACL injury.LONDON, ENGLAND - OCTOBER 27: James Maddison (L), Cristian Romero (C) and Son Heung-Min of Tottenham Hotspur celebrate with teammates after Joel Ward of Crystal Palace (Not Pictured) scored an own goal during the Premier League match between Crystal PalacImage credit: Getty ImagesPlayer of the match - James Maddison (Tottenham)Once again the midfielder was the chief creative force and it was no surprise his cross-shot led to the opener.
